PROJECT: 1G PL PTP (DMA)
AUTHOR: CLAYTON RAYMENT

TOOL VERSION: 2018.1
BOARD: ZCU102-rev1.1
========================

DISCLAIMER:
THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL XILINX SUPPORTED PROJECT - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

DESCRIPTION:
    This project is an implementation of IEEE 1588 PTP in PL using the Xilinx 1588 RTC IP which is used to clock the AXI Ethernet Subsystem's PTP core. The Xilinx 1588 RTC IP in this design expects an input clock of 250MHz which will be automatically programmed into the si570 USER clock when the kernel loads. 

ISSUES:
   -PTP4L in slave mode can not obtain servo lock (s2) due to synchronization errors.
   
USAGE:
Place all files into a new project directory.
    VIVADO:
        From the command line run the following:
            vivado -source *_top.tcl
    
    PETALINUX:
        From the command line run the following:
            petalinux-create -t project -s *.bsp
